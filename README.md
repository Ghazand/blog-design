It is the design of a blog that I have practiced with HTML and tailwind CSS.

The index blog looks like the one below where one post is a feature post, and the rest are arranged firstly in 2 grids. Afterwards three posts subsequently.

That is an individual post design with a tag, title, the body of the post, and the associated user.
